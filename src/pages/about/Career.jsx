        <p>
            I started my career at Affecto Sweden AB, on the 10th of October 2016 as an intern.
            My internship was for a 2-months period, but I did sign my contract mid-November.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, it was a rapid climb up words.
            Within 2 years I went from a junior position to lead roles.
            If I remember it right, I was never a junior developer. I can say that now,
            that I have a few jr. devs, under my wing.
            I have to say skipping that step is a double-edged sword,
            for one end I didn’t have access to the vast knowledge of an experience senior dev.
            However, I did have access to a few brilliant software devs,
            but because I didn’t get the opportunity to work with them closely.
            I had to build up that knowledge base by myself, mostly.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, a good example is that I have written a lot of code what works just fine.
            But it wasn’t built to expand upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact that I was able to take that journey mostly alone have made me into a better developer.
            For instance, I can say I have tried that, and it didn’t work, because of this and that.
            Instead of saying we should not do that because that guy told me it’s a bad idea.
            Having 1st hand experience affects you in a different way.
        </p>

            On my last interview with the woman that recruited me, I asked her why? <br />
            <i> Her answer was:</i> <br />
            <i>Efficiency! You didn't need handholding so;
            we just gave you tuff challenges and saw your grin widen.</i> <br />
            Not a direct quote, but if you call her,
            I don’t think she would say anything different.
            Also, she said it in Swedish, so I had to translate.

            Also, CGI bought Enfo 2018 and we got merged in 2019,
            more than that nothing actually changed. There were some policy changes,
            some new rules. But other than that my work did not change.
