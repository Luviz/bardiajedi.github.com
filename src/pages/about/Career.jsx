        <h3>
            Affecto 2017 – 2019 February
        </h3>
        <p>
            I started my career at Affecto Sweden AB, on the 10th of October 2016 as an intern.
            My internship was for a 2-months period, but I did sign my contract mid-November.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, it was a rapid climb up words.
            Within 2 years I went from a junior position to lead roles.
            If I remember it right, I was never a junior developer. I can say that now,
            that I have a few jr. devs, under my wing.
            I have to say skipping that step is a double-edged sword,
            for one end I didn’t have access to the vast knowledge of an experience senior dev.
            However, I did have access to a few brilliant software devs,
            but because I didn’t get the opportunity to work with them closely.
            I had to build up that knowledge base by myself, mostly.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, a good example is that I have written a lot of code what works just fine.
            But it wasn’t built to expand upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact that I was able to take that journey mostly alone have made me into a better developer.
            For instance, I can say I have tried that, and it didn’t work, because of this and that.
            Instead of saying we should not do that because that guy told me it’s a bad idea.
            Having 1st hand experience affects you in a different way.
        </p>
        <p>
            On my last interview with the woman that recruited me, I asked her why? <br />
            <i> Her answer was:</i> <br />
            <i>Efficiency! You didn't need handholding so;
            we just gave you tuff challenges and saw your grin widen.</i> <br />
            Not a direct quote, but if you call her,
            I don’t think she would say anything different.
            Also, she said it in Swedish, so I had to translate.

            Also, CGI bought Enfo 2018 and we got merged in 2019,
            more than that nothing actually changed. There were some policy changes,
            some new rules. But other than that my work did not change.

            I started my role as a lead developer.
            At the start I was lead dev in name only.
            Slowly but surely, I got more and more responsibilities under my wing,
            it was a different feeling, a different set of challenges,
            and other ways of thinking or dealing with issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            I needed to realize just because I could solve a problem did not mean that I should do so.
            Because as I delivered more, I became the only person to fix the problems on the fly.
            I needed to realize that team was there to help me,
            taking over and solving problems or implementing new features would fill up my schedule more then it should.
            Near the end I was juggling ~6 development projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            What happed was that I more and more work on my desk until was unable to think clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my line of work thinking is the most important thing a developer should be able to do.
            Thinking is the difference between a developer and a programmer.
            Whereas a programmer can write code from function to function, model to object.
            It is the job of the developer to design the software.
            It is by thinking about your software before writing anything at all,
            that you can identify problems before they occur,
            and this workflow is what makes me one of the fasted developers within my circle.
            Because when you have it all figured out all you need is some Metallica and a keyboard.
            Close your thoughts and write...
        </p>
        <p>
            So back to what I was talking about before this paragraph.
            The stress made me lose track over the simplest design pattern software developers use.
            And that is proportional expansion of requests to server.
            In short, my solution was way to slow!
            Problems like these are usually solved by views in SQL databases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t worry I solved the problem, and now the solution is much faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            After identifying the problem, I made some major changes to my way of work. 
            I needed to trust in my devs and give them plenty of opportunity to grow, 
            this is something I didn’t experience because I have mostly worked alone. 
            I have stop looking at code unless the dev is completely unable to visualize the problem and therefore the solution. 
            Talk less, let the dev logic their way throw it.
        </p>
        <p>More to come, just wait...</p>
